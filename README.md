# Mobile-Application-for-detection-Retinoblastoma-eye-cancer
I have developed retinoblastoma eye cancer detection android application. Using python 3.6, Min SDK version 21 , Compile SDK version 30, image processing, machine learning model training and fire base technology. briefly introducing my application, there users have to register themselves. Then registered users have to upload their child's clearly eye images to the system. After that system cut the image into same size two pieces using image processing OpenCV. Then the trained machine learning model identify retinoblastoma cancer and predict results and calculate the accuracy. User can see this accuracy. After that from the option, how it works gives instruction to the user somewhat is retinoblastoma. Also, User can identify nearest doctors and hospitals according to their current location.  Another option is icure clinic from this option user can upload user clinic details monthly and also user can set the reminders for their clinic date.
